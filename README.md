# ObjectivePersonalityTest
A self-report testing tool for typing someone in the Objective Personality system. Reports a person's savior functions, function stack, and first animal in the animal stack.

## NOTE: This should not be used as a substitute for formal typing from the Objective Personality community
Rather, this should be thought of as a means of introspection, as with any other self-reported personality test, within the parameters of a certain flavor of Jungian typology.
